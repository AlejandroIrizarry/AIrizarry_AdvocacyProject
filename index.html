        <h2 id="about">What is Climate Justice?</h2>
        <p title="https://groups.friendsoftheearth.uk/resources/whats-climate-justice">Climate justice recognises the
          climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
          It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently, and that the
          responsibility for the crisis rests with some countries and companies more than others. And it understands
          that
          the lives of those already facing injustice and oppression – like the LGBTQI+ community in Jamaica,  for
          example –
          are made harder by the impacts of the climate crisis <a

        <h2 id="impact">How Climate Change affects communities</h2>

        <p>Due to Climate Change and the negative effects it brings to different communities, it is common knowledge
          that the people who do the least to contribute to climate change, are the ones who pay mostly for it. Due to
          the disproportionaly in our society, people from low-income and underrepresented communities are the ones who
          suffer the worst of its effects. The effects include flooding, rising sea levels, heatwaves, forest fires,
          drought, amonsgt other caused by the climate breakdown.</p>

        <p>This breakdown impacts minority communities that include people of colour, LGBTQI+ people, women, disabled
          people, the working class and generally, people that are categorized as low-income individuals. These
          communities continue, to this day, to face the burdens of choices made by big companies, governments and elite
          classes in first-world countries that overexploit and consume the world's resources, which therefore make the
          climate crisis worse every single day. </p>

        <p>The disproportionality caused by this climate breakdown that these communities have to face, due to lack of
          resources, is one of the greatest injustice of the climate crisis.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Climate Justice</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, not every community faces the burdens of climate change the same way. This is due to the
          unfair distribution of resources that should also be accessible to other communities no matter their economic
          and social status. By enforcing the Climate Justice Movement, we are respecting and protecting human rights,
          supporting right to development, sharing benefits and burdens equitably, ensuring that decisions on climate
          change are participatory, transparent and accountable and the movement also highlights gender equality and
          equity.
